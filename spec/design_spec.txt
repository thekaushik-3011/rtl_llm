# Processor Design Specification (Step 0)
Goal: Generate a simplified 32-bit RISC-V compatible processor using LLM-based RTL generation.

Functional Overview:
1. Supports arithmetic, logic, branch, and load/store instructions (RV32I subset).
2. Includes ALU, Register File, Control Unit, Program Counter, and Memory Interface.
3. Handles interrupts through an Interrupt Controller.
4. Uses single-cycle behavioral RTL for simplicity.
5. Verification via LLM-generated testbenches and assertions.

Interfaces:
- clk: System clock.
- rst_n: Active-low reset.
- instruction[31:0]: Instruction input.
- mem_rd_data[31:0]: Data memory read input.
- mem_addr[31:0], mem_wr_data[31:0], mem_rd_en, mem_wr_en, byte_en[3:0]: Memory interface.
- irq[7:0]: External interrupts.
